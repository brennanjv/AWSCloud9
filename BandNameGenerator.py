# Notes for Day 1
# print("") will print out what is inside the double quotes. I.E print("Hello") would result in console output: Hello
# We love stackoverflow.com for syntax errors/troubleshooting
# \n will create a new line I.E print("Hello\nWorld") will output Hello (new line) World
# Can combine strings with the "+" . I.E print("Hello" + "World"). 
# Note: spaces are important!
# input() function will allow for user input.
# input("What is your name? ") will output 'What is your name? ' and then wait for user to type in
# print("Hello" + input("What is your name")) will ask for name and then print out the Hello + the user input (NESTING)
