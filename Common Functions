print() : will print out what is inside the double quotes. I.E print("Hello") would result in console output: Hello
print(f) : Allows to place variables in strings without having to typecast using {} I.E printf("Hello {variable name}")
input() : function will allow for user input.
len(x) : # number of characters in x
type() : Will check the type of data for a specific variable
str(variable) is typecasting as the new variable type.
round() : Can round numbers to a specified number of decimal places I.E round(2.3333, 2) will round to 2.33
lower() : sets all characters in a string to lowercase
import can be used to import modules
randint(a,b) : gives random interger between a and b (inclusive) and requires random to be imported
random.random() : gives random float between x and y. Y is exclusive. 
List : can store multiple data types I.E fruits = [item1, item2]
Append() : Can add to a list by fruits.append(data) will add to the end of the list. 
Nested List : allows a list to contain multiple list. 
def : defines a function i.e def my_function:
range(x,y) : gives a range between x and y . Y is exclusive
random.shuffle : shuffles the content of a list
join : ''.join(list) , joins list contents into a string


# for loop
# for variable in List:
#   do something
# for number in range(x,y):
#   do something

# while loop
# while x is true:
#   do this!
#x = 5
# while x > 0:
#   do something
#   x -= 1

#count() : gives the number of times a letter occurs in a string. Example below
## name = "brennan"
## print(name.count("n"))
## output would be 3 as there are 3 n's in the string

#if statements (can be nested)
# if condition:
#   do this
# else:
#   do this instead
# Can use elif to check for multiple conditions before else:
Logical Operators : and / or / not

The modulo % is returns the remainder when dividing two numbers
I.E 6 % 2 = 0 as there is no remainder
I.E 15 % 4 = 3
